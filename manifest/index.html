      If you grow as an artist through other people&#8217;s projects, your identity may get lost in fulfilling needs rather than self-expression. I&#8217;ve worked under multiple <a href="http://visesounds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aliases</a> and explored various styles, but now I&#8217;m focusing on my core musical identity. My passion lies in piano, string arrangements, and dreams of working with choirs and organs, blending them with electronic instruments and experimentation.

      So this is about putting together the work of a lifetime. In the early process I&#8217;ve seen how old ideas, maybe even created in a completely different context, completely fit in with what I may have done a month ago, following this everlasting identity I&#8217;ve always had. It&#8217;s all about bringing the layers back to basics.

      With a stable engineering job, I can now create the music I truly want without compromising my vision. While I&#8217;m open to collaborations, I won&#8217;t alter my identity for projects anymore. This isn&#8217;t about rapid releases but about creating the soundtrack of places you may need to go. For sure the soundtrack of places I need to go. And for that, there won&#8217;t be any shortcuts or compromises. I&#8217;m committed to using real instruments and ensembles, even if it means longer production times and more resources. If I have to wait, save for the best string ensemble, and spend countless hours on sheet music, so be it. My goal is to perfect each piece, from arrangement to recording and mixing, ensuring every song is crafted with utmost care and to achieve the balance I pursue.

      I may eventually have numerous songs ready for release, but I&#8217;ll maintain quality over quantity. Singles will be released to maintain an industry presence, but complete albums will be available on my future site from day one of their release. This approach allows for meticulous preparation and balanced mixes. I plan to document this journey through streaming and social media, balancing transparency with my own mental health. If you want to be there when I start releasing this music, you can subscribe to my <a href="../mailinglist/index.html">mailing list</a> or follow me <a href="../links/index.html">wherever</a> you like.
